## Welcome! :wave:
Thanks for checking out this data analysis project on Bollywood movies. :movie_camera: :tada:

**To do this challenge, we need a basic understanding of Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.** :snake: :notebook: :bar_chart:

## The Challenge :muscle:
My challenge was to analyze the IMDb voting and ratings of Bollywood movies and identify the best ones. :mag:

## The Data :floppy_disk:
