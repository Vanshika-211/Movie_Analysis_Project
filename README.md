# MovieAnalysis 

This is an analysis of the highest-rated and highest-voted Bollywood movies from the year 1950 to 2019.

## Welcome! 
Thanks for checking out this data analysis project on Bollywood movies. 

To do this challenge, we need a basic understanding of Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 

## The Challenge 
My challenge was to analyze the IMDb voting and ratings of Bollywood movies and identify the best ones. 

## The Data 
Before we proceed, let's take a look at the data we'll be working with:

- `IndiaMovieDatabase`: This folder contains information about Bollywood movies from the year 1950 to 2019 in multiple csv files which includes columns like 'Title', 'Year', 'Rating', and 'Votes'.

## The Conclusion 
The following conclusions were drawn: 

1. Top-rated Bollywood movie of all time is "Family of Thakurganj" with a rating of 9.4.
2. Top-voted Bollywood movie of all time is "PK" with a total of 143,605 votes.
3. Year-wise highest-rated movie is provided in the graph, which you can check out in the images folder. 
4. Year-wise highest-voted movie is provided in the graph, which you can check out in the images folder. 

## The Analysis 
I used Python along with various data visualization libraries to explore the IMDb ratings and voting data and identify the best Bollywood movies across different years. 

Stay tuned for more insights and visualizations!
